# Welcome to the MetaverseCloud SDK!

The MetaverseCloud SDK for JavaScript is an ever-growing collection of libraries, documentation, utilities, etc. that help developers implement certain features without having to do the work from scratch.  You can find examples of using the javascript client library to build feature extensions, middleware integrations, & standalone real-time applications at https://github.com/metaversecloud-com/sdk-examples.

<br />

## What is MetaverseCloud?

MetaverseCloud is a unique, SDK-driven Platform-as-a-Service (‘PaaS’) offering built to integrate into your clients’ & organization's tech stack and deploy a real time networking solution inside your firewall for ultimate privacy & security of your user information, data, analytics, & interactions.

## What are client libraries?

Client libraries are sets of code that developers can add to their projects. They provide chunks of code that do the basic things an application needs to do in order to interact with an API.

**Key Features**

- Modular Architecture
- Separate package for each client library, grouped in a single, fully importable package
- Lightweight, take only what you need
- Each library should be native, fast, clean, readable, and testable!

If you're an experienced developer and our client libraries don't meet your specific needs, you can collaborate with us on ours or write your own custom client library! Feel free to copy the boilerplate in the `clients` directory to get started.

## Getting Started

We recommend reducing your application bundle size and improving your application performance by only importing the client libraries your application requires. Please navigate to the README.md in the root folder of each library for specifics on how to import each one.
